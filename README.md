# xslt.info
Source code for the xslt.info front-end (now available at [xslt.jvbf.dev](https://xslt.jvbf.dev) so I don't need to pay for two separate domains)

The backend used by the website is the compileonly version of this container: https://github.com/joaovitorbf/xslt-string-server  
Also available on Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/joaovitorbf/xslt-string-server-compileonly
